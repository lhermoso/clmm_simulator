## 💡 Actionable Recommendations

1. **Implement Trailing Stops**: With such high volatility, trailing stops could capture more of the maximum moves
2. **Set Profit Targets**: Consider taking partial profits at 100%, 500%, 1000% levels
3. **Time-Based Exits**: Many best prices occur within days of entry - consider shorter holding periods
